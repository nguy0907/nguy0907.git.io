                    greater number of students to participate in physical and social activity. The Students' Association
                    is committed to and focused on programming that results in our students taking person ownership for

                <p>at Algonquin College is endless. We currently have the Algonquin Commons Theatre where we host a
                    variety of events. Now with the coming of the ARC facility, not only will it be providing more
                    space for the students to study, but it will also be bringing in more room for late-night
                    entertainment.</p>
