    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello all! My name is <strong>Richard Nguyen</strong>  and I am a new student at <strong>Algonquin College</strong>. I am going into <em>Interactive Media Design</em> . 
    It was a difficult choice about what I am going into in college. I either wanted to go into
   <em><abbr title="Interactive Media Design"> IMD</abbr></em> or <em>Computer Programming</em>. I took a course in grade 11 and 12 that is like 
   Interactive Media Design. My grades were very high and now I am in one of my favourite program. I just finished grade 12 and now I am in 
    my next life and looking for my dream job. Nothing will be easy so I have to believe and work my hardest to reach my goal. 

    </p>
    <p> Outside of class,<strong> I love gaming</strong>. I play a lot of games, but I play sports game like NHL, NBA... Hockey and 
        Basketball are my two favourite sports. I am also good at coding as well. I also took computer science in grade 11 and 12.
        This is also my 18<sup>th</sup> year alive. Right now, college is stressful and it is fun at the same time. All I hope is just to learn 
        and have some fun as well. Nice to meet you all and have an amazing day!
        
    </p>
