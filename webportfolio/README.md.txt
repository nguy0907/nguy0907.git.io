Web Portfolio Reflection

The Web Portfolio is not only for the assignment, it can be used for my actual portfolio pieces. 

Some of the biggest issue for me is using only one style sheet. I eventually find out how to put the css code
into the HTML file. My new issue is that I can't figure out how to use bootstrap without stylesheet. In this case,
I have to move on and do everything manually.

The HTML part is obviously the easiest, because I just have to code what you will see or what is displayed on the 
website.
