Web Portfolio Reflection

The Web Portfolio is not only for the assignment, it can be used for my actual portfolio pieces. 


Some of the biggest issue for me is using only one style sheet. I eventually find out how to put the css code
into the HTML file. 

My new issue is that I can't figure out how to use bootstrap without stylesheet. In this case,I have to move on and 
verything manually.

The biggest issue is also me not having motivation. When I think about how much it is worth, and think I won't do 
well, it will be harder for me to put in the work and effort.
 
Another issue is getting the images to grow and centering some cards in the portfolio. The layout is very easy to do,
but the adjustment to the sizes, responsiveness is the issue for the portfolio page.

Since every screen is different is will be hard to know what screen size is correct. I will just assume that 
looking at the media query chart, it will say from the minimum screen I assume that I will make it around that size for mobile.
For tablet, I will use somewhere around 768px since that is the minimum size of the tablet screen. For the desktop screen, I will assume that
it is 1200px, so I will create everything around that area,









The HTML part is obviously the easiest, because I just have to code what you will see or what is displayed on the 
website.

let's talk about what all pages should have:

They all have a header with the logo on the left, there is the menu icon on the right side. You will see all the menu
in the center you have all the navs. Every page with have the same banner, and footer as well. If anything that can be 
used on every page, I will just copy and paste because there is no difference.


Home page: The homepage is the page is the only page what looks the same no matter what page you are on. Everything is 
stretched out more.

About Page: The about page


Other notes:
I added some css in classes in the element. If there is too much to add, I added all the other css part in a 
style tag. The style tag also includes media queries.
