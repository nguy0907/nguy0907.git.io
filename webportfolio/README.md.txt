Web Portfolio Reflection

The Web Portfolio is not only for the assignment, it can be used for my actual portfolio pieces. 

Some of the biggest issue for me is using only one style sheet. I eventually find out how to put the css code
into the HTML file. My new issue is that I can't figure out how to use bootstrap without stylesheet. In this case,
I have to move on and do everything manually. The biggest issue is also me not having motivation. When I think about
how much it is worth, and think I won't do well, it will be harder for me to put in the work and effort.

The HTML part is obviously the easiest, because I just have to code what you will see or what is displayed on the 
website.

let's talk about what all pages should have:

They all have a header with the logo on the left, there is the menu icon on the right side. You will see all the menu
in the center you have all the navs. Every page with have the same banner, and footer as well. If anything that can be 
used on every page, I will just copy and paste because there is no difference.
